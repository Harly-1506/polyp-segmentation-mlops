# ðŸ©º Polyp Segmentation System MLOps

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**Polyp-Segmentation-System-MLOps** is an end-to-end **medical image segmentation** platform designed to detect and segment **colorectal polyps** from endoscopic images.

This project goes beyond traditional model training â€” it show a complete MLOps system that automates the entire machine learning lifecycle: from data ingestion and training pipeline to deployment, monitoring, and continuous delivery.

The platform is orchestrated with **Kubeflow Pipelines** and deployed on **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, using **KServe (Triton Inference Server)** for scalable model serving.
